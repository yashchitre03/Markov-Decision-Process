# Markov-Decision-Process
​	The python program implements the MDP (Markov Decision Process) Reinforcement Learning model. It tries to determine the ideal behavior and maximize its performance towards reaching the goal. It is a type of reinforcement learning problem, where best action is chosen based on the current state. **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** model contains:

- A set of possible world states S.
- A set of Models.
- A set of possible actions A.
- A real valued reward function R(s,a).
- A policy the solution of **Markov Decision Process**.



## Requirement

* Python 3
* Input file (.txt file)



## Prerequisites

* [Markov Decision Process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/markov-decision-process/)

* [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)

  


## Running the tests

​	It contains two different programs for different iterations. One for value iteration and the other for policy iteration. The program will parse the mdp_input text file and obtain the required input.

The program will output the following :

* The moves required to reach the goal state.
* The utility.
* And, the final policy.
